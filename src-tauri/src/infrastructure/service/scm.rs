//! Service Control Manager lifecycle for the optional background service:
//! install, uninstall, start, stop, and a reconciled status read.
//!
//! Status reads need only `CONNECT` + `QUERY_STATUS`, which an unelevated
//! caller has, so the GUI can always reflect real SCM state. Install / start /
//! stop / delete require elevation; in this phase the GUI is still elevated, so
//! they call straight through (an elevated relaunch is a later phase). The
//! current state is always read back from the SCM rather than cached, so a
//! service removed or stopped out-of-band can never leave the UI stale.
