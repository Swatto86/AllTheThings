//! The background service runtime, hosted by the Windows Service Control
//! Manager. Builds an [`Indexer`] (running as LocalSystem, so it can read every

//! pipe — one short-lived handler thread per connection, each answering exactly

//!
//! Reached only via the `--service` command-line branch, which the SCM uses to
//! launch the installed service; a normal GUI launch never enters here.
