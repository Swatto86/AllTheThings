//! The GUI's search backend, chosen once at startup:
//!
//! - [`SearchBackend::Service`] — a background service is running and answered a
//!   version-matched `Ping`, so searches and status go over the IPC pipe and the
//!   GUI does not index at all.
//! - [`SearchBackend::Local`] — no usable service, so the (elevated) GUI indexes
//!   in-process exactly as it did before the service existed.
//!
//! The choice is fixed for the session: if a `Service` backend's service later
//! dies, queries report a degraded status rather than silently re-indexing
//! locally — a mid-session switch would surprise the user with a stale or
//! differently-scoped index.
